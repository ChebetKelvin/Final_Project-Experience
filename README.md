## My Experience

While building WeedShop, I gained practical experience in:

- Structuring a **full-stack MERN application**  
- Using **React Router v6.4+ loaders** for data fetching  
- Designing modern UI with **TailwindCSS + Lucide Icons**  
- Implementing **order tracking & revenue dashboards** with real data  
- Handling **form submissions & validation** in Remix/React environments  
- Creating **responsive, weed-themed layouts** with glowing hover effects  

This project challenged me to think about **user experience**, **data flow**, and **scalable code organization**.  
It also deepened my knowledge of MongoDB, React state management, and admin features for real e-commerce systems.
